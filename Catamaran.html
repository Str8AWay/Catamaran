You control Cap'n Ferdinand Longwhiskers, an especially talented pirate and commander of a crew of fiercely loyal waterskiing squirrels. <br>
The Royal Navy Seadogs have found you, and it is up to you, Ferdie, to make sure they never again are able to harrass any feline pirate. <br>
You also probably want to keep your treasure safe from them. You worked hard for that treasure, after all! Pillaging is no easy task. <br><br>

Movement: arrow keys/WASD to move Ferdie. Press the spacebar to launch one of the crewmates to take down a Seadog ship. Press "R" to reset the game. <br>
Goal: Sink all Seadogs before being sunk yourself. Collect acorns to gather crewmembers, and collect treasure chests to increase your score! <br>
